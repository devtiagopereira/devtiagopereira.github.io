# Tiago Pereira – Dev Portfolio 🌐

Welcome to my personal landing page!  
This site showcases my current projects and progress as I learn web development.

## About This Project

This is a simple portfolio page built using only **HTML and CSS**.  
I'm currently enrolled in Dr. Angela Yu's Full-Stack Web Development Bootcamp on Udemy, and this project reflects what I've learned so far.

As I grow my skills, I will continue improving this page by:
- Adding JavaScript features
- Making it fully responsive
- Highlighting more of my projects

Hi there, I'm Tiago Pereira!

This GitHub Page is for me to play around with what I'm learning about coding. I know zer0 about coding so I'm learning.

Any suggestion is welcome, take in mind that the code in the page is for me to practice. It should be messy but has I learn I'll do it right.

Thank you!
